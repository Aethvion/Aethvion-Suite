"""
core/project_mapper/cleanup.py
DB-mutation helpers for retiring stale entities after incremental scans.

Three distinct operations
-------------------------
1. retire_entity()           — soft-delete one entity + append a timeline event.
2. retire_file_entities()    — retire the module entity AND all contained child
                               entities (classes / functions) for a deleted source
                               file, then remove the file from the FileManifest.
3. prune_removed_symbols()   — retire class/function entities that were removed
                               from a modified source file (called per-file, inline
                               during a scan pass).
4. run_deletion_cleanup()    — full pass: find every manifest entry whose file no
                               longer exists on disk and call retire_file_entities().
                               Called automatically at the end of an incremental scan.

None of these functions perform filesystem writes outside of AethvionDB.

    After re-scanning a modified module, retire child entities (classes /
    functions) that are no longer present in the updated source.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Load the module entity; collect all its "contains" relation targets
       → these are the children from the *previous* scan.
    2. Diff against *new_child_ids* → orphaned children.
    3. For each orphan, retire it only if:
         a. source == "project_mapper"  (we created it, not the user)
         b. The entity's file_path property matches the module's own file_path
            (guards against retiring a same-named entity from a different file)
    4. Rebuild the module's "contains" relations list, excluding retired orphans.
    5. Return the count of entities actually retired.
